  Specified time step is higher than stable time step. Using subiterations.
  2 subiterations will be made with sub_dt = 0.0025
  You may disable this by setting simulation.fixed_dt_subiteration = false.

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 22 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 255.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
